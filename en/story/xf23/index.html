I didn’t choose this focal length because I particularly liked it, but simply because it was affordable. Later, I used the X100V, buying a camera with a fixed lens just to save money. Now, after nearly two years of using the X100V, I haven’t even taken ten thousand photos, which shows that I am not quite comfortable with this focal length.</p><p>This will be the last lens in my Fujifilm X-mount prime lens setup. I had considered buying a macro lens, but after some thought, I gave up on the idea. Now, I feel quite comfortable using the XF56 to take some unboxing photos. Speaking of the 35mm, although it’s touted as the “human eye” perspective, most of the people who can truly utilize this focal length for humanistic photography are either experienced photographers or at least have a strong social or documentary photography background. This focal length is quite close to capturing detailed close-ups of people.</p><p>Fujifilm products are currently not very budget-friendly. This lens used to have a 10% discount during promotions, but now it’s out of stock everywhere, so it’s unlikely to be discounted. The purchase of this lens was also frustrating. I initially chose a store on JD.com that claimed to have it in stock, but two days after placing the order, they informed me there was no stock available, wasting a coupon. I thought about waiting, but then I found another store that had it in stock, but unfortunately, I couldn’t use a coupon this time. During this process, I also contacted a local seller on a second-hand platform, but it was too far away. Luckily, the other JD.com store had it, so I canceled the order immediately.</p><p>In the second-hand market, Fujifilm’s new 1.4 lens series is actually not easy to sell due to its high price. Even the seemingly popular 33mm lens is in short supply with no market demand.</p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/sdngd1cqlhfu425b.jpg alt></p><p>The focal length is the same as the X100V, but with a slightly larger aperture, the performance of the X100V is still quite impressive. It’s currently a very popular model, and the prices have become quite high.</p><p>The focal length of this lens is the same as the X100V, but with a slightly larger aperture. Actually, apart from the focusing performance, the X100V is still quite impressive. It’s currently a very popular model, and the prices have become quite inflated. For everyday use, this lens is still quite good. It’s suitable for capturing everyday scenes, portraits, small objects, and food to document daily life. The beautiful background blur achieved with the f/1.4 aperture is pleasing, and it’s quite comfortable to use for taking a few shots in everyday situations. Compared to a medium telephoto lens, the 23mm lens is mostly used for everyday shooting. It can handle environmental portraits well and is suitable for street photography. The 35mm lens, on the other hand, is great for capturing half-body portraits, small landscapes, objects, and food photography. Environmental portraits are one of the most commonly used scenarios for the 23mm lens, and it’s convenient to take it out and shoot with friends anytime. It can capture the surrounding elements while maintaining a proper proportion of the subject and achieving some background blur.</p><p>Of course, if I had to choose only one lens, I wouldn’t recommend this one. I would suggest the 33mm or 18mm lens instead. If I had to choose again, I would recommend the XF18 for its versatile wide-angle perspective.</p><h2 id=pros>pros</h2><ul><li>Excellent image quality when shooting with the aperture wide open.</li><li>Quiet and fast autofocus, unlike the X100V which can be sluggish.</li><li>Excellent close-up capabilities.</li><li>Well-built with a solid metal construction.</li><li>Weather-sealed (dust, moisture, and freeze-proof).</li></ul><h2 id=cons>cons</h2><ul><li>Purple fringing in backlit situations.</li><li>Electronic focus ring.</li><li>The original square lens hood is too expensive.</li></ul><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/ply3je6z91r1imf5.jpg alt></p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>Since I only have one interchangeable lens camera, I don’t use this particular lens frequently. It’s more of a toy that I take out occasionally. After acquiring the lenses I wanted, I seldom pay attention to new lenses anymore. Occasionally, I watch others’ shares and videos to find a sense of connection, which adds to the enjoyment of experimenting.</p></div><div class="article--tags u-paddingTop20"><a href=/hugo-theme-puppy/en/tags/fujifilm/ class=artile--tag>Fujifilm</a></div><div class=postCat--item><img src=https://static.fatesinger.com/2021/12/vhp6eou5x2wqh2zy.jpg class=cover><div class=postCat--content><a href=/hugo-theme-puppy/en/categories/gears/ class=artile--category>Gears</a><p>fujifilm cameras and lenses</p></div></div></div></main><footer class=site--footer><div class=layoutSingleColumn><div class=copyright>Theme by <a href=https://fatesinger.com/74850 target=_blank>bigfa</a>
